### <a href="http://rednoise.org/rita">The RiTa website</a>

RiTa is designed to be an easy-to-use toolkit for experiments in natural language and generative literature. The philosophy behind the API is to be as simple and intuitive as possible, while still providing adequate flexibility for more advanced users. RiTa is implemented in Java and JavaScript (with a unified API for both) and optionally integrates with Processing. It is free/libre and open-source. Please see https://github.com/dhowe/RiTa/js for the pure JavaScript implementation of RiTa,
